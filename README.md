# CanvasAverages
A Chrome Extension to be used on a grade page on Canvas, a learning management system. 

# Functionality
On the Canvas grade pages, instructors may opt to allow students to try a "what if" score that gives the option to test how a different score would affect their overall grade. 

Most instructors also allow for the average of the class on a specific assignment to be shown. 

When both of these options are enabled, this extension can insert into all "what if" scores the average for the respective assignment. 

Thus, the "what if" average calculated in canvas will be the average grade for the class, giving students the ability to see how they compare to the rest of the class without tedious manual data insertion.
